üß¥ Oil is statically-typed, type-safe, compiled programming language, designed to assist developers.

```oil
use std/io as io

fn main() {
  io.println("Hello, Oil!")
}
```

```oil
use std/io as io

type Juice(multiplier: int) {
  let multiplier: int = multiplier
  pub let juice: int = 0

  pub fn apply(amount: int) {
    self.juice += (self.multiplier * amount)
  }
}

fn main() {
  let juice: Juice = Juice(3)
  juice.apply(10)

  io.println(juice.juice)
}
```

### ToDo
- [x] make anonymous founctions expressions
	- [x] make type annotations for functions: ```let a: fn(): int = f```
- [ ] make check for main function and module in project
- [ ] make for loop
    - [ ] make analyze and compilation for codegen
- [ ] add invalid names as js keywords, such as `class`, `function`, etc...
- [ ] foreign functions mechanism
- [ ] different runtimes
